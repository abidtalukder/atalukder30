Notable Notes:
  - Bootstrap is known for it's responsive design (ie. screen ratios)
  - Fluid containers smoothly move as the screen gets smaller or larger. Normal containers have quite a jagged movement.
  - Containers are required if you're using the BT flavored grid system
  - Grids have rows and columns. You can specify the size of the rows and coloumns.
  - BT also has navbars (which are defaultly responsive)
  - Cards are also a thing but honestly they seem quite normal and not needed to be singled out like that tbh, it's not that special
  - Buttons are very simple to create. One class will dictate all the padding and text styles.
  - Bootstrap offers many code snippets for you to play around with so you can see what you like best.
  - We learned when searching for images in Google that if you click tools and color transparent, it will filter all images to be transparent.

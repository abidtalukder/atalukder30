time spent: 1.6 hrs

DISCO:
* We can display different pages based on user login state by checking inputted username and password with session['username'] and session['password'].
* A form can have multiple inputs, and we can set the default value/display using the value attribute. 
* The order of our if statements means that we return an incorrect username message in the case that both username and password are incorrect.
QCC:
* How is the secret key similar to an fstring (for example: b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/')?
* What is the best way to move on from a single hardcoded account? Using CSV files? Using a database?
* Flask.secret_key is a command that can be used to generate a secret key.

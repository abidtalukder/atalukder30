 The Differences Between the GET and Post Methods
                  
                  Both GET and POST are used to send and receive data from a server using the HTTP protocol, but a major difference between the two is that data using the GET method is sent through URL strings that are appended to the URL. On the other hand, data with the POST method is sent enclosed in the message body so it is more secure in that the data isn't exposed in the URL so a typical user can't see it.
                  
                  Another difference is that POST can send larger amounts of data than GET can.
                  
                  A third difference is that GET requests are cached while POST requests aren't. When I got POST requests to work with my flask app, everytime I reloaded the page, the browser would ask if I wanted to resubmit the data. This means that with every reload the browser must generate input and output and do the calculations again.
                    
                
                  When using GET and POST in our Flask app, we noticed the following differences:
                  
                  The POST request had the message Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded in the request headers and the request args were not shown. I believe that the Content-Type message is to show that the data is secured in the request message body instead of the request headers or args. </li>
                  
                  When actually handling GET and POST data, we saw that we had to use request.args() for GET and request.form() for POST. To handle which one to use, it was crucial that used if statements to difference what type of request method was actually being used. Otherwise, we would run into errors if we used something like request.form() for the GET method.

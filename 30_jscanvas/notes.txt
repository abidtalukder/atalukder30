DISCO:
* clientX gives coordinates relative to the viewport you're interacting with. This is the same as pageX if the viewport is the page
* pageX is relative to the page (so excluding bookmarks bar, taskbar, etc). 
* screenX is relative to your entire screen
* offsetX is relative to the node you're interacting with
* the canvas does not count as a separate viewport
* ctx draws and renders a path separately. It can draw a path, but not render it
* fillStyle() does not have to be redeclared everytime you start a new path
* arc() takes angles in radians
* fill() can be used on unclosed shapes. It will try to close the shape with a straight line

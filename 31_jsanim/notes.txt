DISCO
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Clicking multiple times on a button made the function run in several instances at the same time so the animation went faster.
  We had to turn off the draw button once it started.
* You can remove event listeners with the removeEventListener method
* You can add multiple event listeners to one button to have multiple functions running at the same time
* Arrow functions might be nameless? It seems like you canâ€™t just use the arrow syntax without assigning the whole function to a variable, but the variable is not the name of the function
* Its cool that functions are also variables because they can be passed and used as inputs

QCC
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Is there a method to tell how many event listeners an element has
* What is the difference between var and let in declaring variables
* What is the point of stating <html lang="en"> when you are already typing in english?
* What is the point of declaring the requestID variable?
* What is the automatic assignment of a variable when it is declared? If I type declare var a; is var a saved as null?
